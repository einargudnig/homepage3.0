# My new Websiteü•≥

I finally lunched a new version for my personal website, I have been wanting to finish it for few months.

First thing first!
This site was originially designed by <a href="https://github.com/bchiang7">Brittany Chang</a>

I stumbled up on her website some time ago and instantly loved the design, simple but yet super cool.
So please check here website out and take a look at all the cool stuff she has made.

I thought this would be great starting point to start my updated website. I'm not yet a good designer, so I thought it would be better to start with something and then spend time on changing and updating the site from that. 

I have made some changes to the website.
The biggest change is probably that I built it with React, Brittany made her side with Gatsby. I made the website from a simple  <code>create-react-app</code>

From there I mainly just used the styled components Brittany made.

I had to handle routes in a different way, since React is client-side rendered and Gatsby is server-side.
I've also wanted to start a blog for some time, so I thougth that this would be a great time to start.

The blog posts are markdown files. I found a great playlist on youtube where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT1v33oA1gI&list=PLASldBPN_pkBfRXOkBOaeCJYzCnISw5-Z&ab_channel=willjw3">willjw3</a> built a blog using React, Node and react-markdown. This part of the website will probably go often through some updates and tweeks. I'll probably write a blog post in the future describing the process. 

I also made a dark-mode, since <i>everyone</i> loves dark-mode. It also gave me extra practice to use react hooks.

The website is not complete, there are some things that need to be improved. But I'm happy enough to deploy it, from now on I will add updateds and changes.

I will do a more detailed post about the process of building the website later.
