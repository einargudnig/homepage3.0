# homepage3.0

This is my third iteration at making a personal website!


Note: Just so things are clear, I used Brittany Changs' website as a model. https://github.com/bchiang7/v4. She is building super cool things. Go check her stuff out.

Her website was built in Gatsby, I decided to **rebuild** the website in React.
I started with the `create-react-app` and worked from there.
I added a few things before I deployed the first version, I will add more to the website over upcoming weeks and month.

- Made a Dark-Mode version using custom hook to change the theme from light to dark.
- Build a markdown blog using bits from this tutorial. -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT1v33oA1gI&t=1s&ab_channel=willjw3

These are some of the bigger things I added.

I will write a blog post about the build and add it to the website.
Don't hesitate to send me a message if you have any question
